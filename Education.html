            <h2>PROJECT 1 AUTO-TAXI SYSTEM</h2>
            <h2> AutoTaxi-System</h2>
                <p></p>In groups of 7 we were given an assignment to create any system we want,we came with

                AUTO TAXI is a taxi industry-based software system which provides help to taxi passengers to find a 
                taxi in a respective taxi rank to their destination. The software consists of registered routes which 
                taxis uses from one rank to another to their end destination, therefore on its duty of commuting 
                passengers, at first a user of the AUTO TAXI will gain access by logging in then navigate through the 
                system according to the taxi rank she/he is in and find all the information about the taxis operations, 
                and she will find all places that the taxis in that taxi rank transport passengers, and she/he will 
                choose where he/she is heading. Then passengers will indicate his/her spot of being dropped off 
                through the street’s names or any recognizable location through the AUTO TAXI software in line with 
                the route of a taxi.</p>






                <p>A taxi driver is one of the users too where he/she must through the system sign in his personal 
                credentials, even of the taxi he/she is driving, like registration number and color of the taxi. The taxi 
                driver will activate his/her turn on a line of commuting passengers with the spot in a taxi rank where 
                he/she is parked for passenger can easily identify the taxi. Therefore, after a passenger(s) find a taxi, 
                she/he will identify his/her drop off spot and the taxi driver will receive a message of passenger(s) 
                on where to be drop off on a registered route, of which there is a reminder to the taxi driver when 
                the taxi has reached the spot for a passenger to get off the taxi when it has arrived or reached the 
                spot identified of the passenger.</p>





               <p> It evens support paying taxi fare through the system; therefore, it identifies the passenger who paid 
                through the system to the taxi driver through the spot of being dropped of , as a measure of 
                assurance of valid payment made.
                The AUTO TAXI aims to optimes the way we deal with mobility and make travelling more 
                sustainable and efficient. AUTO TAXI provide solution on convenience public transport, smooth 
                electronic fare transactions, travel time improvement and reductions in delays at intersections. It 
                reduces even the case of being lost when looking for direction at times with misunderstanding when 
                asking people about taxis operations. One of the main benefits is enhancing the safety and quality of 
                life for everyone in urban, even rural areas. Overall, intelligent mobility’s main benefits include 
                better safety, accessibility, and sustainability of transportation systems</p>

SYSTEM PROPOSAL NAME  

IFindTaxi System. 

PROBLEM STATEMENT</h1>
<p></p>The current situation is that when people want to go somewhere they need transport, most people use taxis. The issue is normally overload, change when people have paid and time waisted when the driver takes different routes searching for other people. 
Each request made with a smart device leads to an early transport, correct route at the right time and no payment issues.</p> 


<h1>OBECTIVE USERS OF THE SYSTEM 


IFindTaxi System is a project is aimed at assisting passengers with finding taxi ranks and taxis to their respective desired destination. With just the click of finger any individual can access the software before they can travel to find the nearest taxi rank to wherever they want to go, prices are even displayed in respective of where one want to travel to. Firstly, a passenger will through the software in a taxi rank search to wherever they want to go after finding the nearest taxi rank to an extent of finding where the taxi is located inside the taxi rank line, and they can even pay through the software. It includes taxi drivers too as they play a role of registering their taxi credentials in the system and activating a taxi when it is their turn to commute passengers, so that a passenger can see an active taxi inside the IFindTaxi software as explained above. The primary objective of is for a IFindTaxi passenger to identify the spot of their destination where they want to be dropped off in line with a registered route taxis uses regularly, because in most cases people struggle with drop off spot due to communication misunderstandings of a taxi driver and a passenger.

I am Hlengiwe Mkhabela, a Software Development student currently registered for DSO34BT,  
placed in Group K. I participated in drawing the use cases, event table, non-functional requirements, I created links for virtual meetings and I am the one who was responsible for compiling most parts of our proposal.  
  
Tasks and Key Responsibilities  
26	July 2022 
The WhatsApp group was created and we joined after seeing which group we were assigned to. 
27	July 2022 
We shared different ideas on what kind of system we can create and how it will benefit out target audience. Finally, we picked our top three ideas.  
28	July 2022 
</p>System Idea Proposal : We went to campus to pitch our ideas of the system we had to the lecturers, and the iFindTaxi system was selected as the system we needed to develop .We went through different proposal templates, did research on the type of format that the lecturers could be expecting from us.  
17 August 2022 
We had a meeting where we went through the rubric and divided the work amongst ourselves equally and fairly.  
24 August 2022</p> 
We had a meeting on campus and made all preparations regarding our first evaluation which would take place the next day. We finalized our first tasks.  
05 September 2022  
First Evaluation: This was the day of the presentation of our first assessment. We had to present the first content according to the rubric. The lecturers gave us feedback on our system.
